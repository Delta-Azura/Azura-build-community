Here it's a workspace for people who want to contribute but they aren't known by nutyx devel team.
The work that people are doing here will be include in the official Azura repository, if your work is good maybe you will pushed in the official azura devel team.
As you can see, all of this work is only a test, if these code are pertinent it will be check by the Azura devel team.
PLEASE NOT USE IT IT'S ONLY SOME TEST
